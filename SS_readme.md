# Questions 
Some questions we decided to tackle include but are not limited to:
    -What are the cities with the most stations?    
    -Of said cities, how long is the shelf life of a station?
    -What is the average tracklength for said cities?
    -How prolific are cities at building train stations?

# Caveat 
This dataset is partly historical, and thus is missing a lot of values for time certain earlier time periods 

# Station Building

It comes as no surprise that the city with the most stations in the world also has the highest rate of station building
